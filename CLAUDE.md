# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Working with this Project

This is a learning project. When interacting with this codebase:
- **Wait for the user to ask** for help, feedback, or explanations
- **Do not proactively suggest** code changes or tell the user what to code
- **Provide guidance when requested**: Answer questions about the code, explain implementation details, help debug issues, or review code when asked
- **Be responsive, not directive**: The user is learning and wants to drive their own development process

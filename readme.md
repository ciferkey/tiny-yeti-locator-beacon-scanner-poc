This is some _very_ dirty prototype code to play around with logging observations using the Tiny Yeti Locator from [HackerBox 0119](https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/review-of-hackerbox-0119-geopositioning/).

The project slams together a couple different pieces of example code. They are:
 - _TYL_GPS_Test.ino_ from the [Instutables for HackerBox 0119](https://www.instructables.com/HackerBox-0119-Geopositioning/).
 - From the arduino-esp32 examples:
   - [BeaconScanner](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/libraries/BLE/examples/Beacon_Scanner/Beacon_Scanner.ino).
   - [WiFiScan.ino](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/libraries/WiFi/examples/WiFiScan/WiFiScan.ino).

Note, there is a CLAUDE.md in this project, but I explicitly instructed Claude not to generate code for this project. See the blog post for more details.
